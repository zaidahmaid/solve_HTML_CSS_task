    <h1><u>What is the introduction of math?</u></h1>
    <div>
      Mathematics is the
      <mark>science and study of quality, structure, space, and change.</mark>
      Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish
      truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and
      definitions.

      There is debate over whether mathematical objects such as numbers and
      points exist naturally or are human creations. The mathematician
      <strong>Benjamin Peirce</strong> called mathematics
      <u>"the science that draws necessary conclusions."</u>
      <mark>Albert Einstein</mark>, on the other hand, stated that
      <u
        >"as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not
        certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to
        reality."</u
      >

        Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in
        many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, and the
        social sciences.</u
      >
      Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with the
      application of <strong>mathematical knowledge</strong> to other fields,
      inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads
      to the development of entirely new disciplines. Mathematicians also engage
      in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having any
      application in mind, although practical applications for what began as
      pure mathematics are often discovered later.

    <h1><u>introduction th Chemistry</u></h1>
    <div>
      <mark>Chemistry</mark> is the study of matter and the ways in which
      different forms of matter combine with each other.
      <u>
        You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around
        you</u
      >. Everything you touch or taste or smell is a <strong>chemical</strong>,
      and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our
      universe.

        important, which includes brain functioning, computer operations,
        weather patterns, chemical industries, manufacturing fertilizers, acids,
        alkalis, salts, drugs, soaps, etc.</ins

      Chemistry also acts as a major determinant in meeting the human needs for
      food, healthcare products, and also other materials aimed at improving the
      lifeâ€™s quality.
