    <h2>About Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Programming is a way to "instruct the computer to perform various tasks".
      Confusing? Let us understand the definition deeply. "Instruct the
      computer": this basically means that you provide the computer a set of
      instructions that are written in a language that the computer can
      understand.
    </p>

    <h2>About HTML</h2>
    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML provides a means
      to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text
      such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
    </p>

    <h2>About CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the
      presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS
      is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.
