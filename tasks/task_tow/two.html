    <h2>
      The main difference between HTML and CSS is that while HTML defines the
      structure of web pages, CSS is used to style those pages with a variety of
      different features. If we think of HTML code as the skeleton of a web
      page, CSS would be its skin.

    <h4>
      <ins>HTML consists of text contained within HTML tags</ins>, while
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS</a> is made
      up of declaration blocks and selectors. Where HTML gives a web browser
      display information of various tags,
      <u>CSS enhances that information to the browser </u>by adding styling to
      those HTML tags.
      <br />

      <u>CSS can be included in an HTML document</u>, but HTML cannot be coded
      inside a CSS sheet.
      <br />
      <u>CSS is used for presentation and visual effect</u> — to manipulate
      colors, fonts, and backgrounds, add visual style to sites, prepare images,
      specify margins and borders, and much more — while HTML is not.
