    <p>4 out of 5 stars</p>
    <p>
      From director <strong>Vicki Fleming</strong> comes the heartwarming tale
      of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover (voiced by Brinson
      Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learning the true value of
      friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover
      plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it.
